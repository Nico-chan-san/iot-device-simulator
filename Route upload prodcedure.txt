Route.json upload procedure:

Once you've specified your route in the JSON, use your CLI to upload it to the S3 data bucket's route folder.

Navigate to the directory where the JSON is stored, then run the following command:

aws s3 cp [file] s3://[s3databucket]/routes/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control

Next, you need to refresh the simulation engine. Go to the ECS cluster iot-device-simulation and stop all tasks. It will automatically re-run the tasks, making use of the newly uploaded JSON.
